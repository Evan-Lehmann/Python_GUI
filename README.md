# Python_GUI


This is a GUI made with the Python library Tkinter. It has an integrated API that displays the population, longitude, latitude, state (if applicable), and country of a city. 

Please note, the window size of the GUI is locked due to issues I encountered with resizing. 

Thanks for viewing!
